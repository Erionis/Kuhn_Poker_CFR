# Counterfactual Regret Minimization for Kuhn Poker

This project implements the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium strategies for the game of Kuhn Poker. Kuhn Poker is a simplified version of poker with two players and three cards.

## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to compute the Nash equilibrium strategies for Kuhn Poker using the CFR algorithm. The CFR algorithm is an iterative self-play algorithm that aims to converge to an equilibrium strategy for the game. By running CFR over many iterations, the algorithm gradually improves the strategies and estimates the regret values associated with each action.

## Features

- Kuhn Poker implementation: The project includes an implementation of the Kuhn Poker game rules, including the betting rounds and card dealing.
- CFR algorithm: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm is implemented to compute the Nash equilibrium strategies for Kuhn Poker.
